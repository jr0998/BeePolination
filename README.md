# BeePolination
#First Game Made in Unity
#Commisioned by a friend for a community event that was moved online due to Covid
#Loosly based on the flappy bird concept
#goal of the game is to hit the blue flowers while avoiding the other flowers
#as when bees pollinate flowers they will only pollinate one type of flower at a time
